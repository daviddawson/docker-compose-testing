# Example starter project for docker compose based orchestrated testing

Download

Run up the persistent/ orchestrated services

```
docker-compose up -d rabbit
```


Then, run the test

```
docker-compose run test
```

The test results, in xunit xml format, will now be in test-results

## Extending

You need to add in your persistent services to the docker-compse file, either as images, or more likely as inline builds

Then, update the test to in some way exercise the service.

Finally, rebuild everything and run the test using `docker-compose run test`
